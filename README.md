# Dark Mode Toggler Project

This project is a simple demonstration of how to build a dark mode toggler button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The button allows users to switch between dark and light mode on a web page, changing the background color, button color, and position of the button.

The HTML file contains a basic structure with a div element that holds the button. The CSS file contains styling for the button and the container that holds it. The JavaScript file contains logic for changing the background color, button color, and position of the button when it is clicked.

This project is suitable for beginners who want to learn how to build a simple dark mode toggler button using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It can also be used as a starting point for more complex projects that involve toggling between different modes or themes.
